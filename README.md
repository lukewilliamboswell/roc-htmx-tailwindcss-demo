# Roc + HTMX + tailwindcss Demo

Inspired by the [flowbite-admin-dashboard](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-admin-dashboard), this is an example web app using [roc](https://www.roc-lang.org), [htmx](https://htmx.org), and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com).

![Demonstration of the web app](demo.gif)

This repo aims to provide a simple starting point for building web apps with roc using htmx and tailwindcss.

There's a lot of things that can be improved, and I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to this, so please contribute to this demo and open an issue or submit a PR to help improve it.

## Getting Started

Build using the script `./build.sh`

You will need the following on your `PATH`;
1. [roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/install)
2. [rtl](https://github.com/isaacvando/rtl)
3. [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

Alternatively, run the steps manually and make use of the `--watch` cli commands for a nicer development experience.
